            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                The Falling Star app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices was created by TyrannoRocket (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
            </p>
            <p>
                The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:
            </p>
            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
                <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
                <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
                <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device. However, it does collect your device's approximate location to provide personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
            <p>
                Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties as described in this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policies. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:
